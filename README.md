# Rationale #

Workflow / Seminal Project: A kind of hybrid app involving different languages and tools: Xcode, Swift, a browser, Javascript, React Native, Html5, CSS3, device emulators and many more. This is an in-house solution with a technological update and upgrade.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Hybrid Web-App - App & Native App
* Version 1.1


### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
* Software
     - Xcode, NPM, Bower, Google Chrome, Chrome Developers Toolbox, Docker, Android File Transfer, mobile emulators...
* Dependencies
     - The less, the better. A personal _motto_.
* Database configuration
     - The bibliographic data is converted to _.CSV_ format, in native UTF-16 format. (There are some cyrillic issues, fixed up to now). This is a _must_ condition for proper rendering and meet the rigid deadlines of the iOS ecosystem. Meanwhile, some bibliographic repository project related with this one, can be seen [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/database-on-mobile-device). That in-house solution evolved, and that data leverage this repository, hence this app.  
* How to run tests
     - Soon on the AppStore and Google Play. Meanwhile, some work-around project (ISKM2017) can be seen and downloaded [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iskm2017.app_120833_124594&hl=es).
* Deployment instructions
     - There is no plan to release source code.
