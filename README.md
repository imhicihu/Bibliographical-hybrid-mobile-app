# Rationale #

Workflow / Seminal Project: A kind of hybrid app involving different languages and tools: ~~Xcode, Swift~~, a browser, Javascript, React Native, Html5, Css3, device emulators and many more. This is an _in-house_ solution that it will be evolving in the future

### What is this repository for? ###

* Hybrid Web-App - App & Native App
* Version 1.1


### How do I get set up? ###

* Software
     - ~~Xcode,~~ 
     - NPM
     - Bower 
     - Google Chrome
     - Chrome Developers Toolbox 
     - Brackets
     - Google Spreadsheet
     - [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
     - Docker
     - Android File Transfer
     - mobile emulators
* Dependencies
     - The less, the better. A personal _motto_.
* Database configuration
     - The bibliographic data is converted to _.CSV_ in UTF-8 format. ~~(There are some cyrillic issues, fixed up to now). This is a _must_ condition for proper rendering and meet the rigid deadlines of the iOS ecosystem.~~ Meanwhile, some bibliographic [repository](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/databases-repositories) projects related with this one, can be seen [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/database-on-mobile-device). That _in-house_ solution evolved, and that data leverage this repository, hence this app.  
* How to run tests
     - Soon on the ~~AppStore~~ and Google Play. Meanwhile, some work-around project [(ISKM2017)](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/iskm2017) can be [visited](http://www.imhicihu-conicet.gob.ar/iskm2017/) and the ISKM2017 companion app can be downloaded [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iskm2017.app_120833_124594&hl=es).
