# Rationale #

* Workflow / Seminal Project: A kind of hybrid app involving different languages and tools: ~~Xcode~~, ~~Swift~~, a browser, Javascript, React Native, Html5, Css3, device emulators and many more. This is an _in-house_ solution that it will be evolving in the future.
* This repo is a living document that will grow and adapt over time.

### What is this repository for? ###

* In a nutshell, a hybrid mobile-native app
* Version 1.1

### How do I get set up? ###

* Software
     - ~~[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)~~ 
     - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
     - [React Developer Tools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
     - [Chrome Developers Toolbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
     - [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
     - [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)
     - [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/en/)
     - [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
     - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
     - [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/)
     - mobile emulators:
          * [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/)
          * [Android Studio Simulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
          * [ARChon](http://archon-runtime.github.io/)
* Dependencies
     - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
          + Packages:
                    - [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
     - [Bower](https://bower.io/)
     - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
     - [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
* Database configuration
     - The bibliographic data is converted to _.CSV_ in UTF-8 format. ~~(There are some cyrillic issues, fixed up to now). This is a _must_ condition for proper rendering and meet the rigid deadlines of the iOS ecosystem.~~ Meanwhile, some bibliographic [repository](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/databases-repositories) projects related with this one, can be seen [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/database-on-mobile-device). That _in-house_ solution evolved, and that data leverage this repository, hence this app.  
* How to run tests
     - Soon on the ~~AppStore~~ and Google Play. Meanwhile, some work-around project [(ISKM2017)](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/iskm2017) can be [visited](http://www.imhicihu-conicet.gob.ar/iskm2017/) and the ISKM2017 companion app can be downloaded [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iskm2017.app_120833_124594&hl=es).
